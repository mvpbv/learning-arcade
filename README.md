# Learning Arcade

## Matrix Trainer

Under a time limit click the correct square or input the value inside of the box at that index to truly naturally parse the obnoxious multi-dimensional array convention and not get confused by mat[i][j] being backwards from the (x,y) cartesian coordiates.

## Vim Trainer
An arcade style game that dynamically generates goal posts on a simulated code file to not only learn your vim motions, but push to get quick at them.
